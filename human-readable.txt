Project Plan


1.Project Setup

Create Backend (Node.js + Express):

Set up an Express server.
Install necessary Node.js dependencies (e.g., firebase-admin, express, body-parser, etc.).

Set up Firebase:
Create a Firebase project.
Set up Firestore for employee data storage and Firebase Storage for employee images.
Download and configure Firebase Admin SDK credentials on the server.

 Clone React Employee App:
Clone your existing React employee app.
Modify the frontend to interact with the new backend (Node.js/Express) for data fetching and posting.
Install Axios in React for HTTP requests to Node.js server.

2.Backend Implementation

Create API Endpoints:
Implement routes for addEmployee, updateEmployee, deleteEmployee, getAllEmployees, getEmployeeById, and searchEmployees.
Use Firestore for data persistence and Firebase Storage for file uploads (employee images).
Ensure proper error handling and status code responses for each endpoint.

Integrate Firebase Admin SDK:
Use Firebase Admin SDK to store and retrieve employee data.
Implement file handling logic for image uploads in Firebase Storage.

Test API Routes:
Test all routes with Postman to ensure data is correctly stored and retrieved.

3.Frontend Implementation (React.js)

Modify Employee Form:
Change the form submission from localStorage to sending data to the Node.js backend.
Use Axios to send requests to add, update, and delete employees.

Employee List:
Fetch employee data from the backend via Axios and display it in the existing table.

Search and Filtering:
Implement a search feature in React that queries the backend for employees by their ID.

Image Upload Handling:
Update the FileInput component to handle image uploads via Node.js and Firebase Storage.

.Testing and Debugging

Test both the backend and frontend thoroughly.
Verify the image upload, retrieval, and data persistence using Firestore.

5.Deployment

Deploy the backend (Node.js + Firebase Admin SDK) on a cloud platform like Heroku or Firebase Cloud Functions.
Deploy the React app using Firebase Hosting or Netlify.
